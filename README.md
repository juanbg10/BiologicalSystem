# BiologicalSystem
Modeling. MathematicalModels: stochasticXdeterministic, discreteXcontinuous, staticXdynamic, linearXnonLinear. DynamicalSystems: topology,stability,robustness. MarkovChains: Homogeneous&amp;Ergodic, ProbabilisticBooleanNetworks(PBNs), ProbabilisticGeneticNetworks(PGNs). Some examples of mathematical models for biological systems.
